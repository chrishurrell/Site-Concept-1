# Phase 1

### What we need are machines that can create machines.

More specifically, we need a **Marzek multi-purpose machine**, a laser cutting & welding machine, a bunch of design & development workstations, a comfortable engineering workshop and various other R&D and manufacturing tools needed to design & manufacture objects large and small.

In the future we will build our own tools, but for now we rely on others.
