description: Large-Scale Metal Deposition Manufacturing

# Phase 2

### In order to produce the products we envision, we need to develop a large-scale metal deposition system for additive manufacturing.

This will hopefully give us a competitive advantage since we can theoretically form any large shape using a single process, reducing engineering time and cost and hopefully improving structural strength and durability.

This capability will allow us to initiative **Phase 3** involving space based rapid product development and space colonisation.

\( field tests are scheduled to determine the efficacy of additive manufacturing of large objects \)
