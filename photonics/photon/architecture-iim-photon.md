# IIM Photon : Architecture

## Architecture

IIM Photon consists of a combination of 3rd-party components and in-house developed components

A unique characteristic of modern industrial lasers is the pulsed frequency which results in useful weld patterns.

In order to achieve this with the IIM Photon, specific laser filters and mixers are being developed to create variable frequency pulsed lasers and laser characteristics useful for various applications.

Not only is the Photon designed to offer variable frequency laser output, but also variable wave shaping to achieve unique weld patterns and characteristics.

#### Collector Array

#### A critical component of the IIM Photon is the collector array, which collects solar energy and transfers this energy to the main laser unit via fiber optic cable.

Since the collector array and associated connectors are modular in design, energy collection can range from low \( 50w \) to very high \( 50 Kw \), making the IIM Photon suitable for a wide range of use cases.

The Photon was initially conceptualised for use in space, particularly manufacturing and defence. Due to the abundance of solar energy, energy cost for high-power applications is relatively affordable.

Since no energy is stored or converted, no energy is lost between energy capture and output. The IIM Photon is an optic link and modulator between the sun and the laser target.  


#### Fiber Optic Connectors

Fiber optic cables and connectors are used to transfer light energy between collectors and laser unit.  


#### Waveguide

The waveguide is one of the most critical components in a laser system which takes incohesive light and converts it to cohesive light beams.

Different waveguide designs are being considered, one such design being a twisted hexagonal ruby \( or similar mineral \) rod. The other design, a conventional cylindrical ruby rod.  


#### Splitter

Splitters are used for reducing laser power output, or for transferring light to multiple heads at once.  


#### Mixer

  
Mixers are useful for combining laser beams.  


#### Filter

Filters are used to modify laser light properties, adjusting the light frequency or wavelength using crystal lenses.  


#### Optic Gate

The optic gate is a rotational lens for creating interruptions in a solid light beam for producing variable frequencies ranging from 0 Hz \( 0 RPM \)  to 300 Hz \( 20 000 RPM \).  


#### Dynamic Laser Head

The dynamic laser head offers configurable laser output configurations, patterns, wavelengths for customizing the laser to its intended application whether industrial or medical.
