# IIM Photon : Introduction

The _**IIM Photon**_ represents an exploration into what is possible when solar energy innovations are applied to industrial technologies such as laser systems.

IIM Photon leverages state-of-the-art laser developments to provide an end-product that fits into modern production workflows, allowing easy integration with existing laser systems.

Typical industrial laser welding machines have an output of 50kW.

If used for 7 hours per day results in 350kWh per day, 2450kWh per week, 9800kWh per month and 117600 kWh per year.

Using the Eskom Industrial electricity tariff of R3.38/kWh, this results in an annual electricity cost of R397 488 or roughly R400 000

So to summarize, the IIM Photon can save around R400 000 per year per laser on energy costs.

For larger industrial applications utilising arrays of large lasers, we can realize millions of rands saved on energy costs per year.

Besides the obvious energy cost savings, due to its modular architecture, the IIM Photon can theoretically achieve higher power outputs than conventional industrial laser systems, potentially achieving power outputs of hundreds of kilowatts per laser. While this may seem unnecessary, it is important to note its potential.

The IIM Photon is intended for use in regions with high solar radiance such as Southern Africa, as well as space-based applications.
