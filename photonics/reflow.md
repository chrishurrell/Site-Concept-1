**Reflow** aims to leverage the abundance of gemstones and ceramics mined in Southern Africa to create novel new ceramics, crystals and alloys.  
****

**Reflow** utilises **hydrothermal fusion** as its main process and processes the following materials:

* Diamond
* Quartz
* Ruby
* Sapphire
* Tanzanite
* Topaz

Sourced from:

* Mozambique
* South Africa
* Namibia
* Zimbabwe

Technological Improvements to this process are under development and can be seen in the following products and systems:
