# Photon

The **Quantawave** **Photon** is a laser designed for laser-sintering, welding, smelting and programming and will be used in the [**Frontera RMS**](https://frontera.iim.technology/projects/manufacturing/leoxmf) **\(**rapid maufacturing facility\).

Photon employs a **twisted hexagonal crystal waveguide** manufactured from proprietary materials in order to produce novel beam configurations.

Commercial units are planned with the following capacities: **5kW, 15kW, 35kW and 50kW.**

A typical laser configuration consists of a Photon **concentrator** coupled via **laser-fiber** to a Photon head. Using a combination of Quantawave **filters** and **mixers**, various laser types and strengths can be created from the master beam.

The prototype **5kW & 50kW** Photon installations will be built in **South Africa** in **2020.**

​**Photon** is a product of [**Quantawave**](http://wave.quantacom.co) \( _wave.quantacom.co \)_
