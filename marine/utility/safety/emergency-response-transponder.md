# Emergency Response Transponder

This wearable transponder activates an emergency protocol if the system detects a cut-off, for instance when a crew member falls overboard.

Emergency protocols include activating circular steering in autopilot systems in order to be retrieved in the case of solo sailing.

An alarm is triggered to alert other crew members of the situation.
