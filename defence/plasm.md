# Plasm D1

The **IIM Plasm DU** is a newly conceptualised **plasma energizer** and **defence tool.**

**Plasm** is essentially a **plasma gun** or **plasma cannon** utilising the [**IIM Plasm** plasma module](../photonics/plasm.md).

Theoretical functioning of the **Plasm Defence Unit:**

1. A lightweight, conductive projectile is shot from the cannon.
2. Projectile creates a path for ionisation.
3. Ionisation path is energized with high voltage current.
4. Plasma pulses are formed within the unique geometry of the cannon and propelled down the ionisation path.
5. In targets that allow reflection, Plasm forms a resonant feedback along the ionisation path.
6. Device continues to energize the plasma path in order to maintain contact with the target.
7. The ultracapacitor module is charged by a back-mounted battery pack.

Target power output: **10kW burst** \( 1s \) / **4kW continuous** \( 10s \)
