# H1

The **H1** is a hydrogen-powered thruster, utilising electrolysis to generate hydrogen fuel.

The **H1** thruster uses a similar design to the [**IIM Plasm**](../photonics/plasm.md) module, employing pulsed combustion and cavity resonance dynamics to create an energy efficient thruster.

Uses **IIM Electrolysis** module as well as hydrogen storage tanks.
