# H1 Thruster : Hydrogren Thruster

The **H1** is a hydrogen-powered thruster, utilising electrolysis to generate hydrogen fuel.

The **H1** thruster uses a similar design to the [**IIM Plasm**](../photonics/plasm.md) module, employing pulsed combustion and cavity resonance dynamics to create an energy efficient thruster.

Uses [**IIM E1**](e1.md) ****electrolysis module as well as hydrogen storage tanks.
