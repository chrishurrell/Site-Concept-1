# Grav : Gravitational Energy Storage

## The **IIM Grav** is a gravity energy storage system.

**IIM Grav** uses gravity to store energy much like a dam, but for residential use cases. The device uses isolated inline dynamos for generating electrical energy from stored gravity potential in the form of pumped water.
