# Electron : Battery

### **IIM Battery** develops Energy Storage Solutions for homes, industry, electric vehicles, marine and [**space technologies**](https://frontera.iim.technology) ****using state-of-the-art battery design.

Can be used as stackable array to form a battery or as a variable voltage portable power supply \( variac \) with voltage ranging from 1 - 1000 v. Can be stacked in series or parallel to allow wide customisation potential.

### Lithium Ion vs LiFePo4

We're still experimenting to find the best chemistry to power battery banks, but the choice rests between lithium ion and lithium iron phosphate.

### Features

* Variable voltage & current to fit any electrical requirement.
* Intuitive control panel and user interface for controlling and customising your battery system.
* Optional SMS & email alerting
* High-voltage or current batteries can be created using multiple batteries using _connector-extensions_ and _high-voltage circuit-breaker board & controller._
