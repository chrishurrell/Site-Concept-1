# GTrac

The **QTrac** intelligent magnetic drivetrain system is designed to reduce friction through the integration of electromagnetic bearings and offers continuous energy harvesting while in operation. 

Field testing will provide the data required to assess energy conversion efficiency of QTrak versus conventional mechanical drivetrain systems. 

While the suspension system, in conjunction with existing regenerative braking systems could offer 20-30% energy regeneration, the **QTrac** drivetrain could offer an additional 10-15% energy conversion efficiency in electric vehicles.
