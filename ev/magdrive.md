# GForce

**GForce** is an electric vehicle traction motor for delivering smooth torque, high-power and efficient energy conversion.

**GForce** is designed to work in conjunction with [**GTrac**](magnatrak.md), [**GMotion**](magride.md) and [**Connect**](connect.md). 

**GForce** is designed to work in arrays offering customizable energy output and regeneration and comes in modular 20kw motors. To create an 80kw motor, 4 x 20kw motors are stacked. Arrays can be horizontal or vertical with the use of a gearbox.

By default the motor power output is being harnessed for regeneration. GForce motor systems are designed to integrate with **GTrac** drivetrain regeneration systems to provide a constant stream of recharging energy to vehicle batteries.



### **Common Stacks**

**F1** : **60kW** stack for light sedans

**F2** : **140kW** stack for **SUVs** and **light trucks**

**F3** : **280kW** stack for **buses and light industrial trucks**

**F4** : **1 MW** stack for sports cars & heavy industrial vehicles
