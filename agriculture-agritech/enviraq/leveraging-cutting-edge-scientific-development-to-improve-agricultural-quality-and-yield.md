# Leveraging cutting-edge scientific development to improve agricultural quality and yield

## QAIA Agri is leveraging a new science to improve commercial farming.

In order to ensure healthy crops that absorb & assimilate nutrients easily and produce the harvests we need, we first need to ensure the subtle energetic environment within which they live is balanced and healthy.  


**These factors include**

* Magnetism and the presence of diamagnetic-elements in the growing medium
* Electricity and conductivity
* Radio-Frequency ground saturation
* Telluric currents 

By integrating modifiers into the local environment stray RF, magnetic or electric interference signals can be conditioned to support optimal plant health.

This may even improve the efficiency of fertiliser leading to cost reductions and higher revenue.

QAIA Agri is developing novel solutions for managing crops on a subtle energy level from the roots to the leaves as well as surrounding ambient environments. 

A full scientific report will be available to interested parties in the coming months ahead.
