# EnviraQ : EM Environmental Conditioning & Micro-Climatic-Emulation

## EnviraQ constantly assesses the condition of the ambient environment, including soil for electromagnetic anomalies and corrects them via signal modulation.

EnviraQ is designed to emulate electromagnetic environmental conditions in order to replicate subtle energy conditions found in earth, in space environments.

### The system also allows configuring custom seasonal emulation programs via **EnviraQ EE** in order to test novel yield enhancement techniques. 

**EnviraQ EE** can be used to mimic the ambient EM conditions of Siberia in a contained hydroponic facility in San Fransisco or even the International Space Station.

One interesting feature of **EE** \( which stands for _Environmantal Emulation_ \) is the ability to speed up time - in other words, to fit more hours into a day from the perspective of solar and electromagnetic exposure or influence, which may improve crop quality or yield. 

Further scientific study is required to assess the full impact of _micro-climate-emulation_ techniques.
